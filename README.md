# Task 1: Customer Churn Project
Customer churn or customer attrition is a tendency of clients or customers to abandon a brand and stop being a paying client of a particular business or organization. The percentage of customers that discontinue using a company’s services or products during a specific period is called a customer churn rate. Several bad experiences (or just one) are enough, and a customer may quit.
And if a large chunk of unsatisfied customers churn at a time interval, both material losses and damage to reputation would be enormous.

A reputed bank “ABC BANK” wants to predict the Churn rate. Create a model by using different machine learning approaches that can predict the best result.

# Task 2: Spam Detection Project
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to detect spam messages in SMS text data.
It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a supervised learning algorithm to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham).

# Task 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. 
So, this system is used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. Our aim here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.
The objective of the project is to perform data visualization techniques to understand the insight of the data.
